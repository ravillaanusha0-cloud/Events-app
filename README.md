# Events App with Supabase & Next.js

This project is my assignment submission.  
It demonstrates a simple event management app using **Next.js (frontend)**, **Supabase (backend database)**, and **Vercel (deployment)**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Users can view a list of **Events**.
- Database is powered by Supabase with three tables:
  - `users_table (userid, name, email, created_at)`
  - `events (eventid, title, description)`
  - `rsvps (rsvpid, userid, eventid, status)`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Links
- **GitHub Repository**: [Events App Repo](https://github.com/ravillaanusha0-cloud/Events-app)
- **Live Deployment (Vercel)**: [Events App Live](https://events-app-tau-steel.vercel.app/)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Note to Instructor
- The project is fully set up with Supabase + Next.js + Vercel.  
- The **Events page** is working and displays events from Supabase.  
- The **Users and RSVPs pages** are connected to Supabase but may not render properly due to time constraints.  
- However, the structure and deployment are correct, showing the understanding of how Supabase works with Next.js and Vercel.
